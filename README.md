# Knowledge-Graph-Tool
This project automatically generates knowledge graphs from text and PDF documents using NLP and ML techniques. spaCy is used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract entities, while a Random Forest Classifier with TF-IDF features predicts relationships. Entities and relationships are modeled as nodes and edges using NetworkX and visualized interactively with Pyvis.

A Streamlit interface allows users to upload files, view extracted text, and explore the knowledge graph in real time. Outputs include interactive HTML graphs and in-app visualizations. Deliverables include source code, a small training dataset, and detailed documentation.

Future enhancements aim to improve relationship accuracy with larger datasets, incorporate deep learning models, and support additional file formats like DOCX and HTML. The system provides a scalable framework to transform unstructured text into actionable knowledge for research, business intelligence, and education.
